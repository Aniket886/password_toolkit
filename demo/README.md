## üõ†Ô∏è Available Attack Methods

### Dictionary Attack
```bash
python brute_force_web.py --target http://localhost:5000/login --username admin --wordlist-file ../wordlists/common_passwords.txt
```

### Brute Force Attack
```bash
python brute_force_web.py --target http://localhost:5000/login --username admin --brute-force --max-length 6
```

### Custom Attack
```bash
python brute_force_web.py --target http://localhost:5000/login --username admin --passwords password,admin,123456
```

---

## üìä API Endpoints

The demo includes API endpoints for monitoring:

- `GET /api/users` - List all users (usernames and emails only)
- `GET /api/login-attempts` - View recent login attempts
- `GET /admin` - Admin panel for monitoring attacks

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Lessons

### What Makes This Vulnerable?
1. **No Rate Limiting** - Unlimited login attempts
2. **Weak Passwords** - Common, easily guessable passwords
3. **No Account Lockouts** - Failed attempts don't lock accounts
4. **Predictable Usernames** - Common usernames like 'admin', 'user'
5. **No CAPTCHA** - No human verification required

### How to Fix These Issues?
1. **Implement Rate Limiting** - Limit attempts per IP/user
2. **Strong Password Policy** - Require complex passwords
3. **Account Lockouts** - Lock accounts after failed attempts
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication** - Add second authentication factor
5. **CAPTCHA** - Add human verification for suspicious activity
6. **Monitoring & Alerting** - Log and alert on suspicious activity

## üéØ Learning Objectives

After completing this demo, you should understand:

- ‚úÖ How brute force attacks work technically
- ‚úÖ Why certain security measures are important
- ‚úÖ How to identify authentication vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ The importance of strong password policies
- ‚úÖ Real-world attack scenarios and their impact
- ‚úÖ Ethical considerations in security testing

---

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Custom Wordlists
Create your own wordlist file:
```bash
echo -e "password\nadmin\n123456\nqwerty" > custom_passwords.txt
python brute_force_web.py --target http://localhost:5000/login --username admin --wordlist-file custom_passwords.txt
```

### Multiple Usernames
Test multiple usernames:
```bash
python brute_force_web.py --target http://localhost:5000/login --usernames admin,user,test --wordlist-file ../wordlists/common_passwords.txt
```

### Adjust Attack Speed
Control attack speed with delays:
```bash
python brute_force_web.py --target http://localhost:5000/login --username admin --wordlist-file ../wordlists/common_passwords.txt --delay 2 --threads 1
```

---

## üìà Monitoring Attacks

### Real-time Monitoring
1. Open http://localhost:5000/admin in your browser
2. Start an attack in another terminal
3. Watch the login attempts appear in real-time

### API Monitoring
```bash
# Check recent login attempts
curl http://localhost:5000/api/login-attempts

# List all users
curl http://localhost:5000/api/users
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Website won't start:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the demo directory
cd demo
# Install dependencies
pip install Flask Werkzeug requests
# Try starting again
python app.py
```

**Attack tool errors:**
```bash
# Make sure the website is running first
# Check if localhost:5000 is accessible
curl http://localhost:5000
```

**Permission errors:**
```bash
# Make sure you have write permissions in the demo directory
# Results are saved to JSON files in the current directory
```

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the logs** - Both the website and attack tool provide detailed logs
2. **Read the documentation** - DEMO_GUIDE.md has troubleshooting tips
3. **Verify setup** - Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
4. **Check permissions** - Make sure you have proper file permissions
