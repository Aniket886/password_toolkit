## üéØ Overview

The Password Cracking & Hashing Toolkit is a comprehensive Python educational tool designed to demonstrate:
- How passwords are securely hashed
- Common attack methods against password hashes
- Password strength analysis
- Security best practices

This toolkit implements both offensive (cracking) and defensive (secure hashing) capabilities with strict educational safeguards including rate limiting and length restrictions.

## ‚ú® Features

### üîê Defensive (Security)
- **Multiple Hashing Algorithms**: bcrypt (recommended), SHA-256, SHA-512, PBKDF2, MD5 (educational only)
- **Secure Salt Generation**: Cryptographically secure random salts
- **Password Strength Analysis**: Entropy calculation, pattern detection, OWASP compliance checking
- **Batch Processing**: Hash multiple passwords efficiently

### ‚öîÔ∏è Offensive (Educational Testing)
- **Dictionary Attack**: Wordlist-based with rule variations (leet speak, case changes, number appending)
- **Brute Force Attack**: Systematic generation with checkpoint/resume capability
- **Combined Attack**: Dictionary followed by smart brute force
- **Multi-threading**: Optimized performance with configurable thread count

### üìä Analysis & Reporting
- **Entropy Calculation**: Shannon entropy and character space analysis
- **Pattern Detection**: Sequences, repetitions, keyboard patterns, dates
- **Time-to-Crack Estimates**: Based on character space and length
- **Visual Strength Meters**: Easy-to-understand password strength indicators
- **Export Capabilities**: JSON, CSV, and text format exports

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
```bash
# If you have the files in a folder:
cd password_toolkit
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Verify Installation**
```bash
python src/password_cracker.py --help
```

## üéÆ Quick Start

### Interactive Mode
```bash
cd password_toolkit
python src/password_cracker.py
```

This launches the interactive menu with all features available.

### Command Line Mode

**Hash a password:**
```bash
python src/password_cracker.py --hash "MyPassword123" --algorithm bcrypt
```

**Analyze password strength:**
```bash
python src/password_cracker.py --analyze "MyPassword123"
```

**Crack a hash (with wordlist):**
```bash
python src/password_cracker.py --crack "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8" --wordlist wordlists/common_passwords.txt
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Main Menu Options

1. **üîê Hash Password (Defensive)**
   - Hash single passwords with various algorithms
   - Batch hash multiple passwords
   - Compare algorithm performance

2. **üìñ Dictionary Attack**
   - Load wordlists (built-in or custom)
   - Apply rule-based variations
   - Multi-threaded execution

3. **üî¢ Brute Force Attack**
   - Configurable character sets
   - Length ranges (1-8 characters max)
   - Checkpoint/resume capability

4. **üéØ Combined Attack**
   - Tries dictionary first
   - Falls back to smart brute force

5. **üìä Password Strength Analysis**
   - Entropy calculation
   - Pattern detection
   - OWASP compliance check
   - Detailed security reports

## üß© Modules

### password_hasher.py
Implements secure password hashing with multiple algorithms.

```python
from password_hasher import PasswordHasher

hasher = PasswordHasher()
result = hasher.hash_password("MyPassword", "bcrypt")
is_valid = hasher.verify_password("MyPassword", result['hash'], "bcrypt")
```

### dictionary_attack.py
Dictionary-based password cracking with rule variations.

```python
from dictionary_attack import DictionaryAttacker

attacker = DictionaryAttacker()
attacker.load_wordlist("wordlists/common_passwords.txt")
password = attacker.crack_hash(target_hash, algorithm="sha256")
```

### brute_force.py
Systematic password generation and testing.

```python
from brute_force import BruteForceAttacker

attacker = BruteForceAttacker()
password = attacker.crack_hash(target_hash, charset_config="lowercase", min_len=1, max_len=4)
```

### security_analyzer.py
Comprehensive password strength analysis.

```python
from security_analyzer import PasswordAnalyzer

analyzer = PasswordAnalyzer()
strength = analyzer.check_strength("MyPassword123")
report = analyzer.generate_report("MyPassword123")
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Built-in Safeguards
- **Rate Limiting**: Max 1000 attempts/second to prevent abuse
- **Length Restrictions**: Maximum 8 characters for brute force
- **Educational Warnings**: Displayed at every module initialization
- **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged with timestamps

### Password Security Best Practices
1. **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**: Minimum 12 characters with mixed types
2. **Enable 2FA/MFA**: Add additional authentication layers
3. **Use Password Managers**: Generate and store unique passwords
4. **Regular Updates**: Change passwords for sensitive accounts periodically
5. **Avoid Personal Information**: Don't use names, birthdays, etc.
6. **Check for Breaches**: Verify passwords haven't been exposed

## üìö Educational Resources

### Hashing vs Encryption
- **Hashing**: One-way function, cannot be reversed
- **Encryption**: Two-way, can be decrypted with key
- Passwords should always be hashed, never encrypted

### Time-to-Crack Estimates (1 billion attempts/second)
| Password Type | Length | Character Set | Time to Crack |
|--------------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Numeric PIN | 4 | 10 (0-9) | < 1 second |
| Lowercase | 6 | 26 (a-z) | 5 seconds |
| Alphanumeric | 8 | 62 (a-z,A-Z,0-9) | 7 days |
| All Characters | 8 | 94 (all printable) | 92 days |
| Alphanumeric | 12 | 62 (a-z,A-Z,0-9) | 300 years |

### OWASP Password Guidelines
- Minimum length: 8 characters (12+ recommended)
- Maximum length: 64+ characters
- Allow all Unicode characters
- Check against known breach databases
- Implement account lockout policies
- Use secure hashing (bcrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2)

## üìù Wordlists

The toolkit includes two carefully curated wordlists:

### common_passwords.txt
- **118 unique passwords** (cleaned, no duplicates)
- Most commonly used passwords from real breaches
- Optimized for quick testing
- Quality Score: 90/100 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

### enhanced_wordlist.txt  
- **185+ unique passwords** organized in 18 categories
- Categories include: Common, Numeric, Keyboard patterns, Names, Sports, Tech, etc.
- Includes variations with special characters and substitutions
- Quality Score: 65/100 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Perfect for comprehensive testing

### Wordlist Statistics Tool
Analyze any wordlist with:
```bash
python src/wordlist_stats.py
```

## üéØ Testing

The toolkit includes test data in `tests/test_hashes.json` with known password-hash pairs for validation.

### Running Tests

# Test dictionary attack
python src/dictionary_attack.py

# Test brute force
